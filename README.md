# DS Training

This repo keeps some of my steps along learning data science contents, storing some activities based on the book [Python for data analysis](https://www.amazon.com.br/Python-Para-An%C3%A1lise-Dados-Tratamento/dp/8575226479/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2DJTA1V1T7T8Y&keywords=python+for+data+analysis&qid=1665237954&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjI4IiwicXNhIjoiMi4xMSIsInFzcCI6IjEuODMifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=python+for%2Caps%2C222&sr=8-2), vacation works given by [PET Estatística-UFC](https://sites.google.com/view/petestatisticaufc/), and my own projects.

* [AED Amazon Best Sellings](AED%20Amazon%20Best%20Sellings) - I started a simple and small data analysis project, based on a dataset found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). This work is incomplete and there're a few statistics mistakes on it, but since it was my first project of the kind, I chose to maintain it.

* [Atividade de férias](Atividade%20de%20F%C3%A9rias) - It was an activity developed entirely by [PET Estatística](https://sites.google.com/view/petestatisticaufc/), in which I tried to reproduce and study by my own. This work just made me discover a lot of other new tools to use and apply on my own current and future works, increasing a bit more my knowledge about Exploratory Data Analysis. 

* [Tests](https://github.com/4r7hu3/data-science-learning/tree/main/Tests) - While reading Wes McKinney's book, I was going to try and reproduce some examples and exercises. There's also a Markdown file here, that despite it's not one of the contents of the book, was part of my plans to learn. 

* [Visualization](Visualization) - These are some good practices and recommendations about the use of charts, according to your purposes. There are also some R files which shows my hands-on with ggplot2.

* [Google courses](Google) - Here, I store some files from Google courses I take through Coursera, like "Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate".
